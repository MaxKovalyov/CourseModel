API - main project folder
CourseModel - task folder
CourseModelDb.sql - database for project (created in MySQL)

The project was created on the technology stack: PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL, MVC.
My MVC implementation may be wrong, but I tried =)
Visual Studio Code was used to create the project. The server was started with the PHP Server extension. Implemented CRUD-services and service for saving a report on the workload of professors in an excel file. Excel file is stored "API/report.xlsx"

Database connection settings:
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'name' => 'coursemodel1',
    'user' => 'root',
    'password' => 'root123',
